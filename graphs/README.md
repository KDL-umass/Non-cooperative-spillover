# Network Graph Resources

This README explains how to use code to generate the corpus of graph structures. 



### Corpus

Description.

Note: The SBM networks were used in the paper. The small-world forest-fire models were not recorded during the experiments reported in the paper. Instead we include graphs of these types in the corpus produced according to the same procedure as the set used in the paper. 

**Setup**
* unzip graph corpus

### Real-world networks 
cite SNAP, other external lib

**Setup**
* run load scripts for SNAP library graph

### Synthetic graph generation instructions

**Setup**
* generate synthetic graphs with graph generation algorithms 


#### Stochastic Block Models
Properties. Citation. 
Setup: Install the [SBM benchmark algorithm scripts](https://www.santofortunato.net/resources#h.p_u6MEEWAKyhN0); code available from Fortunato et al.
