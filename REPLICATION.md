This markdown provides instructions for running the experiments in Stick it to The Man: Correcting for Non-Cooperative Behavior in Network A/B Testing. 


## Setup 
1. Download R for your system: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

2. Clone the repo:
 `git clone git@github.com:KDL-umass/Non-cooperative-spillover.git`

3. Set up R environment. Run install script and verify with test Rscript.

## Configure Experiment Settings

4. Set up graph dir: 
* unzip graph corpus
* run load scripts for SNAP library graphs
* generate synthetic graphs with graph generation algorithms 

5. Set up experiment configs. More details at [this README](experiments/configs/README.md).


## Run the Experiments

## Plots from Experiment Data
### Topology and non-cooperative influence
### Non-adversarial bias in ATE estimation
